  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <p style="padding-bottom: 60px; font-size: 45px;">An app that generates recipes for users based on their ingredients currently owned. </p>
  <div>
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 200px">A smart application that generates delicious and nutritious recipes for consumer desires. Within the app there will be various functions and usages such as evaluating the nutritional values of various foods and ingredients which creates recipes that strive to help users that will cater to achieve their nutritional and dietary goals. The end user will be provided a daily report which showcases the amount of nutrition consumed per day such as, calorie intake, carbs, protein, and fat etc.</p>
    <h2>Motivation:</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 200px">Some point in our lives, we have all heard how unappetising and bland eating healthy can be. Due to this reason being one factor as to why people are not inclined to having a healthy diet, developing an app that is designed to generate recipes that provides meals with high amounts of nutrition with such rich taste in its flavour, it allows those who have trouble eating healthy due to its boring and undesirable taste. This app helps to cater unhealthy dietary habits as it will provide many long-term implications such as developing good habits which serves to diminish poor dietary habits. Furthermore, this app serves an educational purpose which allows users to be more mindful with their food sustainability.</p><br>
       <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 200px">An attaching image below showcases on a chart the percentage of U.S. adults who would use an app to track their daily nutritional intake and diet which was conducted via a survey from 962 participants in March 2017. We decided to include these statistics as one of the features that our app provides is the ability to record what sorts of food the users are consuming and additionally the amount of nutrition in each meal. These may include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, fibre and water, as these are essential information needed to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. <br></p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 200px">A personal dietitian for individuals seeking direction and guidance with meal preparations. Depending on the user’s goal (to lose fat, to gain muscle, maintain weight) the app will algorithmically generate a recipe encompassing a meal that satisfies the user’s needs and satisfies the nutritional needs of a person for each meal.<br>

       With many apps currently available to download that provide a list of recipes for the users to prepare, this app differs from the other apps through additional features added that no other app has. This includes the ability for the software to generate recipes through garnering the pre-existing ingredients rather than collecting recipes online that may need some extra ingredients in-order to cook. This is a major step up as this app encompasses a dynamic algorithm which creates recipes based on ingredients already owned rather than spending extra on new ingredients thus benefiting users financially as they do not need to spend for every meal they prepare.<br>

       This app also aims to ensure that we meet all user’s dietary requirements (vegans, vegetarian, food allergies and intolerances, religious reasons such as halal, etc) as health and safety including personal beliefs which should be considered as a top priority when it comes to designing an app related to foods. Hence, offering an additional menu that allows users to select and highlight what they can and cannot consume would benefit all end users.<br>

       One key feature that this app provides is a daily report which highlights the amount of nutrition that is consumed each day which serves to promote a healthy diet as we can reflect on those results and make a positive change to reach our goal. An example of this may include tracking our calorie intake as this impacts our abilities to either lose or gain weight. By keeping a record of how many calories we consume each day we can distinguish whether we are reaching our goals such as a calorie surplus for putting on additional weight, or a calorie deficit for losing weight. In addition to this, if the daily goals are not yet reached by the end of the day, a notification will be sent to remind the user that they have either exceeded the recommended daily calorie intake, or they are well below the recommended daily intake.<br>

       Another attribute is that there is an option that would allow the system to randomly generate a meal if we have not yet planned out our meals throughout the day. This is a useful tool for those who have trouble deciding on what to cook throughout the day inclining them to likely skipping a meal which can result in tiredness as you are not providing your body with essential nutrients. <br>

       This app is focused mainly on being a user-friendly program allowing the user to navigate through the app with ease due to the quick and responsive feedback that this app delivers. For the first time launching this application, you will be asked to provide your height, weight, and age so that the system is able to calculate an accurate representation of what their specific body type is required to achieve a certain goal. However, it is not required if users do not feel comfortable sharing this information with the program. <br></p>
    <h2>Tools and technologies:</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 200px">Before we make any touches on the final product, we must initially plan on how our app is going to look like. This can include the layout of the app, the design such as colours and fonts etc. The planning stage is to be done on ‘Figma’, a website that is used to help design applications. This website is user friendly, allowing new users like us to navigate the website with ease and hence allowing us to progress through the development of the application quicker. We plan on developing our app  through appypie.com, which requires no knowledge in programming whatsoever. Since this is a group project, we will all be splitting off the tasks so that everyone gets assigned an equal amount of work which is to be completed through a shared document on Google Docs. We will also have our own discussion page on Discord so that we are able to communicate and help each other progress efficiently.  It is important that before this app begins its initial stages of development, we must conduct thorough research to be able to make further progresses. We may need to research and analyse some statistics as to what users would prefer to be incorporated in the app. This can be achieved by looking at reviews of similar products on the market as there will be common errors reported that we could prevent from happening. Professional dieticians and chef’s advice may also be an essential human resource as they are able to provide more in-depth information about each recipe.  We could make prototypes of the apps on figma to test and see how everything looks. </p>
    <h2>Skills required:	</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 35px; padding-right: 200px">Due to the website appypie.com allowing us to develop an app without any knowledge on coding, sophisticated skills are not required to be put into use. The only requirement from everyone is to have basic knowledge on how to navigate through the website, hence creating an app will be done so with ease. However, to progress onto the app developing stage we must first plan on how the app is going to look like which is to be done on Figma. A skill that may be required is design as this is a fundamental skill that is required to produce a simple and aesthetic looking product. </p>
