<h2>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</h2>
<p2>



Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Chatterbots are the combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allow computers to understand, analyse and decipher users input to produce a solution without requiring further human intervention. It allows communication from human language to be converted into something that is understood by a computer. This process doesn’t come easy as machine language is quite basic and the complexity of human language is difficult to be taught to a machine. 
<br>
<br>
The process of how NLP typically would work via audio
<br>
<ol>
<li> User interaction with the system </li>
<li> The system records the audio </li>
<li> Converts the audio into text </li>
<li> Processes the text to attempt to understand the user </li>
<li> Processing solution </li>
<li> Respond to the User (can be audio or any other communication method) </li>
</ol>

Some of the common places you may interact with a NLP AI would be 
<br>
<ul>
<li>Google Assistant (Android & Google home) </li>
<li>Siri </li> 
<li>Alexa </li>
</ul>
<br>
These programs allow you to activate and command tasks towards your device without any physical input and only using your voice. They require a command to start the functionality. Which would mean that the microphone is constantly active waiting for the command to begin its operation.

Some examples: 
<ul>
<li>Calls and Texts - “Call Mum”
<li>Set alarms / Reminders - “Remind me in 30 minutes to check on the Oven”
<li>Calculations - “Convert pounds to kilograms”
<li>Music - “What is this song?”
<li>Information from the internet - “When did Michael Jordan retire?”
</ul>


The processing of NLP needs to understand the command that you’ve provided, process it, and then alert you in human language of the outcome. 

NLP in Chatterbots are used on websites to provide users with information or direct the user to the right section to complete their enquiry. 
The chatterbot can either be as part of a “help me” section or a messenger style notification will pop up asking if the user requires any assistance. 

A Chatterbot takes the input that it has been provided and then will output a solution to the user. 
The Chatterbot will examine the information provided, then follow certain logic adapters. 
These logic adapters are programmed by the developer to try and pre-empt the potential inputs.
If the input meets those requirements, then a successful output is completed.
This could vary from providing a link, explaining steps, or even understanding that the enquiry is too complex for itself and transfer the enquiry to a human to finalise the enquiry.

<br>
<br>

NLP doesn’t have to always be a tool used by a business to sell a product or provide a service.
It can be a tool that provides help to a user, in such programs like Grammarly there is analysis on your text and then possible issues and solutions are provided to the user. 
Predictive text is used in the Google search engine where the text is constantly being analysed to either provide possible searches based off what is currently in the box.


<br>
<br>

Another place that NLP is used for business are contact centres where the technology is improving the effectiveness, efficiency and reducing employee requirements. 
When calling a contact centre, the automated response will determine the best possible outcome for the caller to be directed. 
The NLP system transfers the caller to the relevant department, or to an automated recorded response to provide the information to the caller. 
The automated recording allows for the business to put their FAQs and potentially stop the call from needing any further action by an employee. 
This is critically important for contact centres that receive a large volume of calls every day as it reduces the amount of calls waiting to be serviced by an employee.

<h4> The Future </h4>
<br>

<p2>
The continuous improvement in technology and the further improvement to teaching machines the human language, will allow processing of large amounts of data to continue to grow substantially. This will continue to allow for analysis at a large scale to be processed at once and provide meaningful data. It is especially useful when processing data and reporting the information such as the sentiment, theme and categories of data. It allows business to further understand the customer’s satisfaction of product or service through their interactions with the business. This information has replaced the typical focus groups or surveys that were previously used to understand whether a customer is satisfied with a company. 
<br>
<br>
NLP will continue to further develop into making life easier for people, the improvement in personal assistance technologies will continue to expand, allowing for more seamless productivity
The impact of these technologies continuously improving and being introduced into different aspects of business, will mean that most of the enquiries users have in the future with business may not even be with a human at all. This will allow for quicker but impersonal resolutions, this would be a struggle for people who want to have a personalised conversation with someone about their issue or help to get what is required or feel like they’re issue isn’t generic and just solved by a computer. When it comes to voice-recognition,
<br>
<br>
There would be an influx of hiring of specific skilled workers in the company who would be all parts of managing the backend of NLP or Chatterbots. This will be to ensure that the system is working, improvements, data management, continuous improvement to the language of understanding for Artificial intelligence. There would be requirements for Data Scientist specialists to determine how NLP systems would continue to analyse the data further for the benefit of the company. The information and analysis provided by the NLP can be linked to different products and determine whether or not there is a specific sentiment towards a product which would help the business further develop and improve on. 
The ability to access a huge range of data in relation towards something helps with knowledge of what the customer actually is feeling towards the company. 
<br>
<br>
There would be a large amount of redundancies for workers depending on what the function of NLP has been introduced into their company. As NLP becomes more prolific due to the development and more complexed programming there would be no requirement for employees to fulfil such a task anymore. Some jobs that would be replaced would be;

<ul>
<li>The online customer service employees could have a smaller team working due to the fact that the majority of the simple enquiries have already been autonomously managed by the Chatterbots and doesn’t require human interaction. </li>

<li>The call centre would require less people because half of the callers are dealt with autonomously.</li>
<li>People surveying customers to get their feedback on products and services </li>
</ul>

<br>
The people who hopefully experience the greatest benefits would be the customers. It would be a seamless transaction that the customer would be able to find a solution to their issue in the most efficient and effective way and would continue to keep their satisfaction about the organisation.
<br>
<br>
The organisation would be able to save money on their staffing numbers as there would be reduced amount of work required to be done by an employee. From here there would be more profits and then further development on the business could continue, or more profit for the owner in general.
