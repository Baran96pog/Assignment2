  <h2>Natural Language processing and chatterbots</h2>
  <p2>



  Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Chatterbots are the combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that allow computers to understand, analyse and decipher users input to produce a solution without requiring further human intervention. It allows communication from human language to be converted into something that is understood by a computer. This process doesn’t come easy as machine language is quite basic and the complexity of human language is difficult to be taught to a machine.
  <br>
  <br>
  The process of how NLP typically would work via audio
  <br>
  <ol>
  <li> User interaction with the system </li>
  <li> The system records the audio </li>
  <li> Converts the audio into text </li>
  <li> Processes the text to attempt to understand the user </li>
  <li> Processing solution </li>
  <li> Respond to the User (can be audio or any other communication method) </li>
  </ol>

  Some of the common places you may interact with a NLP AI would be
  <br>
  <ul>
  <li>Google Assistant (Android & Google home) </li>
  <li>Siri </li>
  <li>Alexa </li>
  </ul>
  These programs allow you to activate and command tasks towards your device without any physical input and only using your voice. They require a command to start the functionality. Which would mean that the microphone is constantly active waiting for the command to begin its operation.
  <br>
  Some examples:
  <ul>
  <li>Calls and Texts - “Call Mum”
  <li>Set alarms / Reminders - “Remind me in 30 minutes to check on the Oven”
  <li>Calculations - “Convert pounds to kilograms”
  <li>Music - “What is this song?”
  <li>Information from the internet - “When did Michael Jordan retire?”
  </ul>


  The processing of NLP needs to understand the command that you’ve provided, process it, and then alert you in human language of the outcome.

  NLP in Chatterbots are used on websites to provide users with information or direct the user to the right section to complete their enquiry.
  The chatterbot can either be as part of a “help me” section or a messenger style notification will pop up asking if the user requires any assistance.

  A Chatterbot takes the input that it has been provided and then will output a solution to the user.
  The Chatterbot will examine the information provided, then follow certain logic adapters.
  These logic adapters are programmed by the developer to try and pre-empt the potential inputs.
  If the input meets those requirements, then a successful output is completed.
  This could vary from providing a link, explaining steps, or even understanding that the enquiry is too complex for itself and transfer the enquiry to a human to finalise the enquiry.

  <br>
  <br>

  NLP doesn’t have to always be a tool used by a business to sell a product or provide a service.
  It can be a tool that provides help to a user, in such programs like Grammarly there is analysis on your text and then possible issues and solutions are provided to the user.
  Predictive text is used in the Google search engine where the text is constantly being analysed to either provide possible searches based off what is currently in the box.


  <br>
  <br>

  Another place that NLP is used for business are contact centres where the technology is improving the effectiveness, efficiency and reducing employee requirements.
  When calling a contact centre, the automated response will determine the best possible outcome for the caller to be directed.
  The NLP system transfers the caller to the relevant department, or to an automated recorded response to provide the information to the caller.
  The automated recording allows for the business to put their FAQs and potentially stop the call from needing any further action by an employee.
  This is critically important for contact centres that receive a large volume of calls every day as it reduces the amount of calls waiting to be serviced by an employee.


  <br>
  <br>

  <p2>
  The continuous improvement in technology and the further improvement to teaching machines the human language, will allow processing of large amounts of data to continue to grow substantially. This will continue to allow for analysis at a large scale to be processed at once and provide meaningful data. It is especially useful when processing data and reporting the information such as the sentiment, theme and categories of data. It allows business to further understand the customer’s satisfaction of product or service through their interactions with the business. This information has replaced the typical focus groups or surveys that were previously used to understand whether a customer is satisfied with a company.
  <br>
  <br>
  NLP will continue to further develop into making life easier for people, the improvement in personal assistance technologies will continue to expand, allowing for more seamless productivity
  The impact of these technologies continuously improving and being introduced into different aspects of business, will mean that most of the enquiries users have in the future with business may not even be with a human at all. This will allow for quicker but impersonal resolutions, this would be a struggle for people who want to have a personalised conversation with someone about their issue or help to get what is required or feel like they’re issue isn’t generic and just solved by a computer. When it comes to voice-recognition,
  <br>
  <br>
  There would be an influx of hiring of specific skilled workers in the company who would be all parts of managing the backend of NLP or Chatterbots. This will be to ensure that the system is working, improvements, data management, continuous improvement to the language of understanding for Artificial intelligence. There would be requirements for Data Scientist specialists to determine how NLP systems would continue to analyse the data further for the benefit of the company. The information and analysis provided by the NLP can be linked to different products and determine whether or not there is a specific sentiment towards a product which would help the business further develop and improve on.
  The ability to access a huge range of data in relation towards something helps with knowledge of what the customer actually is feeling towards the company.
  <br>
  <br>
  There would be a large amount of redundancies for workers depending on what the function of NLP has been introduced into their company. As NLP becomes more prolific due to the development and more complexed programming there would be no requirement for employees to fulfil such a task anymore. Some jobs that would be replaced would be;

  <ul>
  <li>The online customer service employees could have a smaller team working due to the fact that the majority of the simple enquiries have already been autonomously managed by the Chatterbots and doesn’t require human interaction. </li>

  <li>The call centre would require less people because half of the callers are dealt with autonomously.</li>
  <li>People surveying customers to get their feedback on products and services </li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  The people who hopefully experience the greatest benefits would be the customers. It would be a seamless transaction that the customer would be able to find a solution to their issue in the most efficient and effective way and would continue to keep their satisfaction about the organisation.
  <br>
  <br>
  The organisation would be able to save money on their staffing numbers as there would be reduced amount of work required to be done by an employee. From here there would be more profits and then further development on the business could continue, or more profit for the owner in general.

  <h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos</h2>
  <br>
  <p2>



  Raspberry Pis and Arduino’s are mini sized computers that allow a user to program and customise different operations, process a function or display information. They are small sized circuit boards which consume low power and are great if you want to make something ordinary into something with computing power.
  <br>
  <br>
  The key focus for both of these companies is to encourage people to start programming and allow the accessibility of getting started without the buyer having to commit a large financial stake or have prior knowledge of programming. The low cost of the products and the wide variety of information provided to the public is also backed up with their open sourced software allowing everyone to be able to access the source code of how the device operates. Both companies provide a wide range of resources to help users get started with their devices as well. The support doesn’t stop with just the website as both devices have large communities which provide information on how to create their creations they’ve made prior with their source codes.
  <br>
  <br>
  Arduino’s are open sourced with their hardware manufacturing of the circuit board which has allowed many different manufacturers to replicate Arduino’s device for sale. This encourages competition between suppliers which ultimately reduces the cost of the device to the public. Allowing for easier the technology to be valued at the cheapest possible. Raspberry Pi is not open source with their hardware but does provide all the information on how their circuit boards work.
  <br>
  <br>
  There are many iterations of the Raspberry Pi, as technology over the years have improved functionality and performance has been increased on the device. Although it isn’t fully self sufficient, you will still need to buy a monitor, keyboard and mouse.
  <br>
  <br>
  The device itself has the following components attached to the circuit board

  <ul>
  <li>ARM CPU/GPU [Processor and graphic processor] </li>
  <li>GPIO [general-purpose input/output connection] </li>
  <li>RCA [connection to analog TVs and other devices] </li>
  <li>Audio out [3.55 millimeter jack] </li>
  <li>LEDs </li>
  <li>USB port/s </li>
  <li>HDMI port [High definition compatible devices]</li>
  <li>Power [5v micro USB] </li>
  <li>SD card slot [Storage] </li>
  <li>Ethernet [Internet connection] </li>
  </ul>
  The operating system is Linux which the user can begin to code exactly the functionality of what they want the device to do. Although there is a limit on the amount of processing power of a Raspberry Pi (in comparison to an everyday computer), the capability of the device still allows it to be used to create some extraordinary products.

  <br>
  Just to name a few


  <ul>
  <li>A Raspberry pi can be made into a functioning mirror with heads-up display of information, the device is connected to the internet and display information such as the weather, reminders of what you have on for the day, how long it’ll take you to get to work.</li>
  <li>A video doorbell which connects to your phone to display the video feed.</li>
  <li>Air quality monitor, which provides information </li>
  <li>Streaming device which connects to your TV</li>
  </ul>

  Arduino’s functionality can be used to create more complex devices or robotics. This allows for a more complex functionality of what is capable. The device can be programmed to be able to detect different methods of input (lights sensor, motion sensor, physical inputs) and provide an output depending on the programming design.
  <br>
   The connectivity to other electronic components allow for creation of devices such as
  <ul>
  <li>Robot (ability to control via phone or computer input) </li>
  <li>RC cars (radio-controlled cars) </li>
  <li>Security Systems. (keypad recognition & keycard identification)  </li>
  </ul>

  This is just the beginning of what could be done as the ability to customise your own devices will allow creativity to flow and people to start developing their own creations. There is a huge range of resources available to start learning on the Aurdino’s website, and other websites out there if you wish to begin making such devices.
  Ardunio’s software is cross compatible with different operating systems, (MacOS, Windows, Linux etc) which allows users to continue using what’s more familiar to them and allow for getting into starting a much easier transition than other devices.
  <br>
  <br>
  The impact of having open source code is that there is a huge community that provides how-tos with all the relevant information so you can learn and create it by yourself.
  This is great in encouraging more people into programming and robot creation as the skill to program these devices can be quite daunting if you are unaware of where to begin.
  <br>
  <br>
  The future improvement of technology and hardware as a whole will continue to trickle down to these micro devices. As memory has improved and size efficiency is optimised, this allows for more processing power without increasing the expense for the customer.
  The affordability of these devices are important to the future of providing these products to developing countries and for students who want to learn more about programming. It allows the youth to be able to learn programming and develop different products for their needs.
  The devices that would be able to be produced will continue to expand as the capability of the devices will increase as well.
  <br>
  <br>
  The continuing growth of Raspberry Pi’s and Arduinos are going to always encourage more people to get into coding and creating devices that will improve their lives and those around them. Allowing people who want to create something in relation to computers. There will always be a continuing growth of interest from people getting into these devices if the functionality continues to grow.
  <br>
  <br>

  As a student looking at creating technologies in the future, these devices allow easier access to create my own devices and learn from other peoples experiences in developing the device. The entry to cost into making these devices isn’t too expensive which is great for getting started.
  <br>
  <br>
  Gaining these skills will allow for the ability to get experience on end to end production of a product before joining a company and have confidence in the ability in these fields. Most employers want to hire someone who has experience with a project so they can continue working on developing their products without beginning from no experience at all.
  <br>
  <br>
  The ease of access of this information also allows friends and family who are not studying, or haven’t studied programming to begin and start to get things created on their own without having to study robotics at school. The resources available on Raspberry Pi and Arduinos allow for self-paced learning and development of skills.
