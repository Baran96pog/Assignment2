    <p><strong>4. Who are all the different people you interacft with in your work? Please tell us about them.</strong></p>
    <p>The different people I usually communicate with at work are employees, telecommunications, computer supplies and resellers. Mostly employees though.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Please tell us about your interactions with ohter IT professionals.</strong></p>
    <p>	My boss is my main communication with other I.T. professionals, as he tells me what needs to be done and such, but I do talk to other professionals in my office, mainly about work.</p>
    <p><strong>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors.</strong></p>
    <p>The interactions with clients and investors are not really done by me, they are mostly done with my boss. He deals with all the major I.T. work and make sure everyone is in line.</p>
    <p><strong>7. What aspect of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</strong></p>
    <p>I spend a lot of time dealing with small issues, such as password resets. Aswell communicating to other offices overseas to help them troubleshoot also. I am kind of like a help desk.</p>
    <p><strong>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</strong></p>
    <p>The hardest part of my job is when something goes wrong in the comms room, as it can affect a whole department. A solution needs to be found asap to get things up and running again and it can take some thinking.</p>
    <p><strong>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the I.T. industry?</strong></p>
    <p>An example of the work I do is the quote “have you tried turning it off and on again?”. As I work with employees, they are not really that good with I.T., so they approach me with simple problems that can be fixed with ease.</p>
